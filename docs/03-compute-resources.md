# Provisioning Compute Resources

Kubernetes requires a set of machines to host the Kubernetes control plane and the worker nodes where containers are ultimately run. In this lab you will provision the compute resources required for running a secure and highly available Kubernetes cluster across multiple [Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions-availability-zones) (AZ).

> Ensure a default region has been set as described in the [Prerequisites](01-prerequisites.md#set-a-default-compute-region) lab.

## Networking

The Kubernetes [networking model](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#kubernetes-model) assumes a flat network in which containers and nodes can communicate with each other. In cases where this is not desired [network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) can limit how groups of containers are allowed to communicate with each other and external network endpoints.

We are going to use [VPC CNI plugin](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s) created by [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) team so Kubernetes pods will be using VPC network ip addresses without any overlay network.

> Setting up network policies is out of scope for this tutorial.

### Virtual Private Cloud Network

In this section a dedicated [Virtual Private Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) (VPC) network will be setup to host the Kubernetes cluster. To simplify this you can use Cloudformation template [network.yaml](../templates/network.yaml):

```
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name hardway --template-body file://./templates/network.yaml
```

This template will provision a VPC with 10.100.0.0/16 CIDR divided into three small subnets in three AZ for masters nodes with ip ranges:
- 10.100.0.0/23
- 10.100.2.0/23
- 10.100.4.0/23

and three bigger subnets in three AZs for worker nodes and pods:
- 10.100.16.0/20
- 10.100.32.0/20
- 10.100.48.0/20

Worker subnets must be provisioned with an IP address range large enough to assign a private IP address to each node and pods on this node in the Kubernetes cluster, since pods use IP addresses from the same subnet where their node is ([more info about CNI over VPC plugin for AWS](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/blob/master/proposals/cni-proposal.md)).

CloudFormation template also creates other related resources, such as Internet Gateway and route table. You can override the VPC CIDR and subnets' size providing parameters differ from defaults.

If you want to create VPC and subnets manually with AWS CLI you can follow [official AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-subnets-commands-example.html) just remember to spread your subnets for master and worker nodes per AZ and choose appropriate subnet sizes with the above considerations.

### Firewall Rules

Create a firewall rule that allows internal communication across all protocols:

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create kubernetes-the-hard-way-allow-internal \
  --allow tcp,udp,icmp \
  --network kubernetes-the-hard-way \
  --source-ranges 10.240.0.0/24,10.200.0.0/16
```

Create a firewall rule that allows external SSH, ICMP, and HTTPS:

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create kubernetes-the-hard-way-allow-external \
  --allow tcp:22,tcp:6443,icmp \
  --network kubernetes-the-hard-way \
  --source-ranges 0.0.0.0/0
```

> An [external load balancer](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/) will be used to expose the Kubernetes API Servers to remote clients.

List the firewall rules in the `kubernetes-the-hard-way` VPC network:

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter="network:kubernetes-the-hard-way"
```

> output

```
NAME                                    NETWORK                  DIRECTION  PRIORITY  ALLOW                 DENY
kubernetes-the-hard-way-allow-external  kubernetes-the-hard-way  INGRESS    1000      tcp:22,tcp:6443,icmp
kubernetes-the-hard-way-allow-internal  kubernetes-the-hard-way  INGRESS    1000      tcp,udp,icmp
```

### Kubernetes Public IP Address

Allocate a static IP address that will be attached to the external load balancer fronting the Kubernetes API Servers:

```
gcloud compute addresses create kubernetes-the-hard-way \
  --region $(gcloud config get-value compute/region)
```

Verify the `kubernetes-the-hard-way` static IP address was created in your default compute region:

```
gcloud compute addresses list --filter="name=('kubernetes-the-hard-way')"
```

> output

```
NAME                     REGION    ADDRESS        STATUS
kubernetes-the-hard-way  us-west1  XX.XXX.XXX.XX  RESERVED
```

## Compute Instances

The compute instances in this lab will be provisioned using [Ubuntu Server](https://www.ubuntu.com/server) 16.04, which has good support for the [cri-containerd container runtime](https://github.com/containerd/cri-containerd). Each compute instance will be provisioned with a fixed private IP address to simplify the Kubernetes bootstrapping process.

### Kubernetes Controllers

Create three compute instances which will host the Kubernetes control plane:

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
  gcloud compute instances create controller-${i} \
    --async \
    --boot-disk-size 200GB \
    --can-ip-forward \
    --image-family ubuntu-1604-lts \
    --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud \
    --machine-type n1-standard-1 \
    --private-network-ip 10.240.0.1${i} \
    --scopes compute-rw,storage-ro,service-management,service-control,logging-write,monitoring \
    --subnet kubernetes \
    --tags kubernetes-the-hard-way,controller
done
```

### Kubernetes Workers

Each worker instance requires a pod subnet allocation from the Kubernetes cluster CIDR range. The pod subnet allocation will be used to configure container networking in a later exercise. The `pod-cidr` instance metadata will be used to expose pod subnet allocations to compute instances at runtime.

> The Kubernetes cluster CIDR range is defined by the Controller Manager's `--cluster-cidr` flag. In this tutorial the cluster CIDR range will be set to `10.200.0.0/16`, which supports 254 subnets.

Create three compute instances which will host the Kubernetes worker nodes:

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
  gcloud compute instances create worker-${i} \
    --async \
    --boot-disk-size 200GB \
    --can-ip-forward \
    --image-family ubuntu-1604-lts \
    --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud \
    --machine-type n1-standard-1 \
    --metadata pod-cidr=10.200.${i}.0/24 \
    --private-network-ip 10.240.0.2${i} \
    --scopes compute-rw,storage-ro,service-management,service-control,logging-write,monitoring \
    --subnet kubernetes \
    --tags kubernetes-the-hard-way,worker
done
```

### Verification

List the compute instances in your default compute zone:

```
gcloud compute instances list
```

> output

```
NAME          ZONE        MACHINE_TYPE   PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP     STATUS
controller-0  us-west1-c  n1-standard-1               10.240.0.10  XX.XXX.XXX.XXX  RUNNING
controller-1  us-west1-c  n1-standard-1               10.240.0.11  XX.XXX.X.XX     RUNNING
controller-2  us-west1-c  n1-standard-1               10.240.0.12  XX.XXX.XXX.XX   RUNNING
worker-0      us-west1-c  n1-standard-1               10.240.0.20  XXX.XXX.XXX.XX  RUNNING
worker-1      us-west1-c  n1-standard-1               10.240.0.21  XX.XXX.XX.XXX   RUNNING
worker-2      us-west1-c  n1-standard-1               10.240.0.22  XXX.XXX.XX.XX   RUNNING
```
